DEPRECATED: this command (`check`) has been DEPRECATED, and will be unsupported beyond 01 June 2024.


We highly encourage switching to the new `scan` command which is easier to use, more powerful, and can be set up to mimic the deprecated command if required.

DEPRECATED: this command (`check`) has been DEPRECATED, and will be unsupported beyond 01 June 2024.


We highly encourage switching to the new `scan` command which is easier to use, more powerful, and can be set up to mimic the deprecated command if required.
